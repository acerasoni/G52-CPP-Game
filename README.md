# Wolf-Assault-CPP
Fantasy side-scroller RPG developed in C++

Intro:
You are a powerful Knight in the midst of a Wolf assault. Kill as many wolves are you can, collect gold, and upgrade your equipment to increase strength and stamina.
Jump on the moving platforms to avoid wolves reaching you. And don't forget to chase the Wolves with low health, as they will run away!

Commands:
A: Move left
D: Move right
Q: Attack
E: Jump
Space: Keep pressed to run faster. This will consume stamina, which will increase back over time until it reaches maximum value.

When inside the inventory, click on an armor piece (helmet, chestpiece, etc.) and then click on the golden coins on the bottom right to upgrade the item. Each item can be upgraded 3 times. 
And remember, each subsequent upgrade will cost more gold!
